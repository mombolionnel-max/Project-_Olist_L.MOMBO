## Description

Brazil represents the largest e-commerce market in Latin America with a population of 213 million inhabitants. 
an ultra-connected population where the smartphone is largely ingrained in consumption habits. In this immense 
country with a unique geography and an economic disparity between the different segments of the population Brazil 
presents unique logistical and financial challenges. Olist (is a Brazilian e-commerce company founded on July 15 2015 in Curitiba) 
attempts to meet this challenge.  his business model is a marketplace focused on providing technology solutions for e-commerce, 
primarily for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Brazil. In this project, i try to identify some key indicators of the company.

##  Key Analysis Steps

The code generally follows this workflow:

Data Preparation: Merging the web data and joining all DataFrames.
Cleaning: Handling missing values and formatting variables.
Statistical Test: Using the test like T-test and Chi² test for Proportions to validate the observed difference.
Visualization: Creating bar charts and "funnel" plots to compare the progress of the two groups step-by-step.
